# Supervised-ML-classifier-for-LG-optical-modes
Scripts for a small machine learning project, whereby I created a convolutional neural network to classify various images of turbulent optical modes.

The raw data is available upon request. The zip folder contains the processed data.

Included is a script to grab frames from a video file.
